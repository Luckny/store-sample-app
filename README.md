# StoreSampleApp

A store simple store application that uses the basic functionalities of **Angular**.

## What I Learned

- **Angular** Components
  - I used the `CLI` to generate components with the command: `ng generate`.
- Passing data between components
  - I used the `Input` and `Output` decorators to pass data between child and parent components.
- The angular router
  - I used the routing module to route between views of the application.
- Angular Services
  - In the command line, i generated the cart service that help manage the data.
- HTTP CLIENT
  - I used the `HttpClientModule` to simulate a get request to a json file
- Angular forms
  - I used the form builder to create a dynamic form for user input.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
